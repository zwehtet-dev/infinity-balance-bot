```
see about message , 
client want to do that, if staff reply sale message, bot check staff name,
if 'San', have to update San`banks . eg. if ocr detect KBZ and replied staff name is San, have to update `San(KBZ)-11044185`,
if 'Thin Zar Htet', have to update TZT` banks,
if 'MMN' , have to update MMN` banks,
if 'Nandar', have to update NDT` banks,
etc ...
for that, I have idea for that, 
bot must be use sqlite db and create store command 
as /set-user @user {prefix_name_in_balance_topic}
and then bot must be store user id and prefix_name in database, 
when staff reply , get prefix name by user id and update balance message

and bot must be handle new feature ,
bot must be handle for new topic 'Accounts Matter', 
they use this topic intenal bank transfer,
staff send as 
```
[receipts]
San(Wave Channel) to NDT (Wave)
```
for that bot must be detect amount from receipts and have to reduce San(Wave Channel) amount and have to increate NDT (Wave) amount 
and then have to notify to auto balance topic with new balance
and usdt amount can be wrong in 0.03














K Pay P account holders - San, Thin Zar Htet

Wave account holders - San, Nandar (NDT)

Wave Channel account holders - San


For USDT Transfer, 
ACT Wallet is for receiving, and Swift is for sending. (Swift is also Wallet and used for sending)

In Account Matter Topic, it is a topic for transferring between admin bank accounts

CSTZ = San

USD margin for 0.03
